🚀 SEEDING LIVE CLASSES - STEP BY STEP
=====================================

⚠️  IMPORTANT: MongoDB Must Be Running First!

STEP 1: Start MongoDB
====================
Open a NEW terminal/command prompt and run:

    mongod

Wait for this message:
    "waiting for connections on port 27017"

Leave this terminal open while seeding.

---

STEP 2: In Another Terminal, Go to Backend
===========================================
    cd c:\Users\NAYEEM\OneDrive\Desktop\learn-grow-fullstack\grow-backend

---

STEP 3: Run the Seeding Script
==============================
    npm run db:seed-live-classes

OR directly:

    node seed-500-classes.js

---

EXPECTED OUTPUT
===============
You should see:

TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

❌ "connect ECONNREFUSED"
   → MongoDB is not running
   → Make sure you ran 'mongod' in step 1
   → Wait for "waiting for connections on port 27017"

❌ "Cannot find module 'mongoose'"
   → You're running from wrong directory
   → Make sure you're in: grow-backend folder
   → Run: cd grow-backend first

❌ "EADDRINUSE: address already in use"
   → MongoDB port is already in use
   → Change port or kill existing MongoDB process

---

VERIFY IT WORKED
================
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/instructor/live-classes/
2. Refresh the page
3. You should see 500 classes (pagination shows 10 per page)
4. Try "Mark as Done" button on a scheduled class
5. Try adding a recording link on a completed class

---

That's it! Follow these 3 steps and you'll have 500 classes seeded.
